# Kaggle Ghosts, Ghouls, and Goblins Competition
This repository contains the R script used for my participation in the Kaggle Ghosts, Ghouls, and Goblins competition. The goal of the competition was to classify different types of monsters based on their features.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying monsters into three categories: ghosts, ghouls, and goblins. The model uses various features such as bone length, rotting flesh, hair length, presence of soul, and color to make accurate classifications.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following features:

**id:** Unique identifier for each entry

**bone_length:** Normalized measure of bone length

**rotting_flesh:** Normalized measure of rotting flesh

**hair_length:** Normalized measure of hair length

**has_soul:** Normalized measure of the presence of a soul

**color:** Color of the monster (e.g., clear, green, black, white, blue, blood)

**type:** Type of monster (ghost, ghoul, goblin) - target variable


## Model
